You can find the solution to this chapter in this [link](https://github.com/Anwarvic/Basic-Data-Structures/tree/master/Trees) where you can find the Tree Data Structure I have built before. 

The 4.1 problem's solution can be found in the `BinaryTree().is_balanced()` method.

The 4.3 problem's solution can be found in the `BST().__init__()` method.

The 4.4 problem's solution can be found in the `BinaryTree().level_nodes()` method.

The 4.5 problem's solution can be found in the `BST().traverse(method="inOrder")` method.



The rest will be solved very soon, In Shaa' Allah
